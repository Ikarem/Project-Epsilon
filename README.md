Overview:<br>
- Built using the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architecture in **C#**.<br>
- Dynamic front-end powered by JavaScript under the **wwwroot** directory with a backend written in C#.<br>
- Practical applications of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts including Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.<br>
- RESTful APIs to manage communication between the front-end and backend.<br>

### 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **C# Programming:** Applied OOP principles such as classes, interfaces, and method overriding.<br>
- **MVC Architecture:** Organized the application into Models, Views, and Controllers for modularity and maintainability.<br>
- **Backend Development:** Built RESTful API endpoints for data handling and server-side operations.<br>
- **Frontend Integration:** Connected JavaScript-based UI in `wwwroot` with backend services through asynchronous API calls.<br>
- **Data Management:** Utilized Models for structured data representation and dynamic content rendering.<br>
- **Encapsulation & Abstraction:** Ensured secure access to backend logic while simplifying code complexity for maintainability.<br>
- **Code Reusability:** Demonstrated inheritance and polymorphism for scalable and adaptable system behavior.<br>

### Preferably Ran Through Visual Studio
### Alternative:

Before running, ensure that **.NET SDK** is installed on your system.<br>

Run the web application:<br>
`dotnet run`<br>

Open the browser and navigate to:<br>
`https://localhost:5001` (or the assigned port displayed in terminal).<br>
